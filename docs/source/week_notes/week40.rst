General
-------

- I worked with the terminal and  my distribution of linux, I found some
  problems with differents commands to install aplications and packages,
  working in the root, commands to open programs from the terminal,, etc.
- I read more about **markdown files** and *syntax*. I used more the vim
  editor, I dont know if **I like it...**, I used also vstudio for that.
- I install powerline in order to see always in wich project and branch Im
  working in the terminal.
- I conected myself to the idiap server and download the course of
  reproducibility, videos, slides, conclutions.
- I open the file gitconfig; new alias with the line push/merge. I tried to use it with the modification of this file. 

Concl. Activity n.4

A project that follow the work methodology of reproducibility is a project that:

- We can run and obtain the same results each time.
- Is a robust, structured, serious, well made project.
- Is like a box with all the necessary to run and reproduce the project; report, code, data, instructions.
- Let the owners, developers and external people understand later how they did the project and start at any time very quickly with the all background necessary.
- Is a operational project at any time.
- Take more time but in a professional way increase the quality of the project.
- Prepare all the necessary for reproduce the project let you check each step in order to see errors/problems/fakes conclutions.
- Is in order with the scientific methode and the scientific way of work and responsability for the conclutions. The community can see that and valored the work from a pure light.
