Creation of a project in sphinx (`Docum-Project in RTD <https://docum-project.readthedocs.io>`_): 

- Hows its works sphinx; reading documentation, utility in documentation, possibilities and customization, commands, work dynamic.
- Study of syntax and edition of *rest* files.
- Integration of jupyter notebooks. Working with .ipynb files. Resolution of problems. Writing in .md syntax.

Yaml files | CI/CD Pipelines
----------------------------

Review of the basic concepts of yaml files:

- A format for config files, examples in gitlab, github, kubernetes, docker, etc.
- Easy reading; serialization code like xml (<>), json ({}), yaml (line separations and _sangrias_).
- Basic syntax: key-values pair, objects, attributes, lists, comments, variables, levels, etc.
- Yaml checker.

A second review of Pipelines:

- Understanding of the basic structure (stages, jobs, steps) and the hierarchy in the file.
- Different scenarios of configuration of a yaml file: multistages, multi jobs, etc.
- Sequential order for stages. Parallel order for jobs.
- Workflow: commit, test, build, push and deploy.
- Utility of on and trigger.
- Analysis and edition of the sample gitlab CI/CD configuration file, changing his structure.

Little questions

To finish with the concepts:

- Will I need in the future to make a python package or something like that? In order to put effort into it.. 
- If we will work with CI/Pipeline, can I put to run some pipeline in use in my repo to undertand how its works? 
- Do I need to configure anaconda/ install some package python maybe??? 
- I need to know something specific about licenses?
