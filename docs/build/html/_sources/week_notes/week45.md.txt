## DICOM set file 
DICOM data set can include and represent different DICOM objects, included or supported by the standard; images, text reports, audios. The input and output volumes are files _.NRRD_.


## Output data
According to the process followed, the volume straightened is a file _.NRRD_, a method for storing and representation of n-dimension raster data. If we analyze the header of one volume obtained, its characterized by:

- Nrrd file type: one file.
- Dimension: 3.
- Size: 99x99x70 (ZxWidthxHeight).
- Type: int (acording with the NRRD documentation, its means: 4-byte integer).
- Encoding: gzip.

Working with the file .NRRD its possible to:
- Open it with python, using the _pynrrd_ package.
- Convert it to different formats like, jpeg and variation, tiff, etc.
- Save the file like a DICOM data set with other studies. 
- Anonymize patient info working only with .nrrd files.


## Just curiosity
For the next steps:

- There is a pre-processing of the input data needed?
- There is a data set to train the model?
- There is a model of prediction?
